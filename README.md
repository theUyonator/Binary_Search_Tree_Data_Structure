# Binary_Search_Tree_Data_Structure
This repo holds the code to a BST class with a few methods:

**insert**
  - This function should insert a node in a binary tree. It should return the BinarySearchTree and should be solved using iteration.

**insertRecursively**
  - This function should insert a node in a binary tree. It should return the BinarySearchTree and should be solved using recursion.

**find**
  - This function should find a node in a binary tree. It should return the node if found, otherwise return undefined. This should be solved using iteration.

**findRecursively**
  - This function should find a node in a binary tree. It should return the node if found, otherwise return undefined. This should be solved using recursion.

**dfsPreOrder**
  - This function should search through each node in the binary search tree using pre-order depth first search and return an array containing each node’s value.

**dfsInOrder**
  - This function should search through each node in the binary search tree using in-order depth first search and return an array containing each node’s value.

**dfsPostOrder**
  - This function should search through each node in the binary search tree using post-order depth first search and return an array containing each node’s value.

**bfs**
  - This function should search through each node in the binary search tree using breadth first search and return an array containing each node’s value.
